## 4. Rules Synthesized by the Multi-Agent Advisor
| Rule ID | Forensic Evidence | Digital Twin Verification | WAF Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `biz-ban-ip-169-254-54-10` | IP detected with 625 recorded attacks (benign, sql_injection, path_traversal, xss, rate_limit_ddos) and 80.2% verified hostility rate. | **✓ 0% FP Certified** | Saves deep SAT evaluation by immediately dropping this IP in Fast-Path via SAT-BIZ-02. |
| `biz-method-api-users` | Route /api/users exhibits legitimate traffic restricted to methods ['GET']. Hostile probing or unconstrained attack surface detected. | **✓ 0% FP Certified** | Closes attack surface by dropping unsupported methods (DELETE, PUT, PATCH, TRACE, CONNECT) via SAT-BIZ-01. |
| `biz-method-api-v1-search` | Route /api/v1/search exhibits legitimate traffic restricted to methods ['GET']. Hostile probing or unconstrained attack surface detected. | **✓ 0% FP Certified** | Closes attack surface by dropping unsupported methods (DELETE, PUT, PATCH, TRACE, CONNECT) via SAT-BIZ-01. |
| `biz-method-api-v1-users-profile` | Route /api/v1/users/profile exhibits legitimate traffic restricted to methods ['GET']. Hostile probing or unconstrained attack surface detected. | **✓ 0% FP Certified** | Closes attack surface by dropping unsupported methods (DELETE, PUT, PATCH, TRACE, CONNECT) via SAT-BIZ-01. |
| `biz-method-api-waf-metrics` | Route /api/waf/metrics exhibits legitimate traffic restricted to methods ['GET']. Hostile probing or unconstrained attack surface detected. | **✓ 0% FP Certified** | Closes attack surface by dropping unsupported methods (DELETE, PUT, PATCH, TRACE, CONNECT) via SAT-BIZ-01. |
| `cloud_sync_pending_anomalies` | Detected 14 novel unobserved pattern anomalies across 2136 production occurrences pending cloud synthesis. | **✓ 0% FP Certified** | Compiles anomalies into baseline SAT equation reducing gate count by up to 80%. Estimated consumption: 1 Silicon Unit (SU). |
